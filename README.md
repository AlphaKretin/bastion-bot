# Bastion

**Bastion** is a [Discord](http://discordapp.com/) bot for displaying information about the _Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game_. It's written in Node.js using the [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris/) Discord API library, and relies on my [ygo-data](https://github.com/AlphaKretin/ygo-data) module for parsing YGOPro databases.
